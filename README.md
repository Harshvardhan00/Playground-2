```
In a python program when printing statements it needs to be in quotation either in single or double but printing a statement without a quotation gives an error.
Consider, printing a statement: Hello This is my First Python program.
Sol: print("Hello This is my First Python program.")
      OR
     print('Hello This is my First Python program.')
```
