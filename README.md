>>STRINGS
```
In a python program when printing statements it needs to be in quotation either in single or double but printing a statement without a quotation gives an error.
Consider, printing a statement: Hello This is my First Python program.
Sol: print("Hello This is my First Python program.")
      OR
     print('Hello This is my First Python program.')
```
>>COMMENTS
```
Adding # at the beginning will make the entire line a comment.
Comments will not be executed when running code, so you can use them to leave notes.
```
>>INTEGERS
```
You can use numbers like integers in programming. Unlike strings, they don't need to be enclosed in quotes. You can add and subtract integers just like you do in math. The spaces before and after operators are not required, but they will make the code easier to read.
Ex: print(3+5)
      OR
    print(2 + 4)
```
>>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRINGS AND INTEGERS
```
Strings and integers are interpreted differently in programming. Like the images below, 3 + 5 will print 8, which is the result of the addition. However, if you enclose it in quotes and make it a string, the output will stay as 3 + 5.
Ex: print(3+4)
      OR
    print('3+4')
```
>>VARIABLES
```
A variable is like a box with a name in which you can store a value.
DEFINING A VARIABLE:
To store a value in a variable, you need to define a variable. You can do this in the following format: variable_name = value. The = operator in Python does not mean "equal". This assignment operator means assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. Note that variable names don't need to be enclosed in quotes.
Ex: name = 'JOHN'
      OR
    number = 34
```
